# Python-Lesson5
This is the 5th week of python classes

This repository demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python through practical examples:

1. Defining Classes and Objects:
    1. Learn how to define classes, create attributes, and call methods for objects.
    2. Example: A Car class with a color attribute and a drive() method.

2. Constructors and Instance Variables
    1. Use constructors (__init__) to initialize objects with unique attributes.
    2. Example: Create Car objects with distinct color and model attributes.

3. Inheritance
    1. Understand how subclasses inherit attributes and methods from a base class.
    2. Example: A Vehicle base class with Car and Bike subclasses inheriting wheels.

4. Polymorphism
    1. Explore how the same method name can have different behaviors across classes.
    2. Example: A speak() method that returns "Woof!" for Dog and "Meow!" for Cat.

5. Encapsulation
    1. Learn to keep class attributes private and control access through methods.
    2. Example: A SecretStash class with a private __chocolates attribute accessible only through specific methods.

This collection of examples is a foundational guide for anyone learning or revisiting OOP principles in Python.

HAPPY CODING!!!
